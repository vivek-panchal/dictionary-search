# Dictionary Search CLI

A command-line dictionary search application that provides word definitions and spell-check suggestions using efficient data structures.

## Features

- **Word Lookup:** Quickly find definitions of words.
- **Spell Check Suggestions:** If a word is misspelled, it suggests possible correct words.
- **Auto-completion:** Uses a **Trie** to provide word suggestions based on prefixes.
- **Interactive CLI:** Uses a simple command-line interface for user input.
- **Color-coded Output:** Uses `chalk` for enhanced CLI aesthetics.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime environment
- **Chalk** – Terminal string styling
- **Readline-Sync** – Synchronous user input handling

## Data Structures Used

- **Trie (Prefix Tree)** – Used for fast word searching, prefix-based suggestions, and spell-checking.
- **HashMap (JavaScript Object)** – Stores dictionary words and their definitions.
- **Array** – Used for handling suggestions and alternative spellings.
